# Requirements for ML-based NER (Hybrid approach)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements_ml_ner.txt

# Core ML libraries
transformers>=4.30.0
torch>=2.0.0

# Optional: for better performance
# accelerate>=0.20.0

# Note: If you don't have GPU, torch will use CPU (slower but works)
# For GPU support, install PyTorch with CUDA from: https://pytorch.org/
